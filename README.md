A Starter Project using Webpack and ReactJs. This project helps you in getting started with an environment where you just focus on getting your app done. All development and production related settings and configurations are taken care as in-built options.

- `yarn install`
- `yarn start` to start the app in dev mode.
- `yarn build` to build the app for production.
